# Cryptographic Factorization Algorithms

This project presents the implementation and performance analysis of several key integer factorization algorithms that are fundamental to modern cryptography.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The following algorithms were implemented in Python:

- **Miller-Rabin Primality Test** â€“ probabilistic test to determine if a number is prime.
- **Pollardâ€™s Rho Algorithm** â€“ probabilistic factorization algorithm effective on semi-primes.
- **Fermatâ€™s Factorization Method** â€“ classic method for factoring integers with close factors.
- **Quadratic Sieve** â€“ advanced factorization algorithm suitable for larger numbers.

Each algorithm was evaluated and compared based on execution time, success rate, and computational complexity.

## ðŸ“„ Project File

- `factorization.py` â€“ contains all algorithm implementations and runtime comparison.
